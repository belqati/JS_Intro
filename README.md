*JS_Intro* incorporates material from the JS lessons from the course *Modern JavaScript from the Beginning* by [Brad Traversy](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/). The notes incorporate material I found to be of interest and/or worth summarizing again for pedagogical purposes. The stated goal of the course is to help web developers become comfortable enough with JS to move completely away from JQuery (except as a dependency), and be better prepared for using frameworks such as Angular or React. The notes reflect this intention.

The accompanying `app.js` holds all scripts illustrating the relevant lessons, more-or-less thorough comments for explanation, and additional material for further understanding.
