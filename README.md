# What is This?

*JS_Intro* incorporates my summary notes in HTML format of the introductory JS lessons from the course *Modern JavaScript from the Beginning* by [Brad Traversy](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/). The notes incorporate only some of his material, while the `app.js` is a JS scratchpad with my version of his examples, accompanied by my own comments as explanation and additional research.
