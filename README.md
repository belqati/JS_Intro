# Introduction

*JS_Intro* incorporates material from the introductory JS lessons from the course Modern JavaScript from the Beginning by [Brad Traversy](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/). The notes incorporate only material I found to be of interest, while the `app.js` is a JS scratchpad with comments.
